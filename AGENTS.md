# AGENTS.md — working in oh-my-gjc

Agent-facing guide for `oh-my-gjc`, a **plugin marketplace** for Gajae Code (`gjc`).
Read this before adding or editing plugins. Human-facing intro lives in [README.md](./README.md).

## What this repo is

A single git repo that catalogs installable `gjc` plugins. One `marketplace.json`
lists every plugin; each plugin is one directory under `plugins/`. The format is
compatible with the Claude Code / Codex plugin spec.

Plugins install from the **shell CLI** — `gjc plugin install <name>@<marketplace> …`
(TARGETS is plural: install several in one command; `--scope user` is the default,
`--scope project` pins to a repo; `gjc plugin marketplace add <ref>` registers a
catalog; `gjc plugin list` shows installed). Inside a running `gjc` **chat session**,
use the `/plugin` slash command instead — there, a typed shell `gjc plugin …` line is
just a message. Both routes hit the same marketplace manager / install registry
(`~/.gjc/plugins/installed_plugins.json`).

## Setup / Environment

### gjc
- Install gjc, then sign in to model providers via OAuth (Claude / OpenAI Codex / Kimi — no API key needed). Model presets:
  - `gjc --mpreset claude-max` — highest quality
  - `gjc --mpreset kimi` — cheaper worker / parallel
- **API keys** (web search, Gemini, etc.) must live in a **trusted location**, NOT the project `cwd/.env` (gjc ignores cwd `.env` for credentials). Copy the template and symlink it into your gjc home:
  ```sh
  cp .env.example .env                 # then fill in keys
  ln -sf "$(pwd)/.env" ~/.gjc/.env     # run once from the repo root
  ```
  Credential precedence: live env → `~/.gjc/agent/.env` → `~/.gjc/.env` → `~/.env`.
- **Web search:** `gjc config set providers.webSearch exa` (fallback: duckduckgo). Full key list (Exa/Tavily/Gemini/…) is in [`.env.example`](./.env.example).

### Plugin prerequisites
- `codex-cli-control` / `codex-deepwork`: Codex CLI installed + signed in (`codex --version`, `codex login status`). Plugins never auto-install or auto-login.
- `codex-deepwork` (recommended): LazyCodex harness — `npx lazycodex-ai install` — adds deep-work skills/agents/verification to Codex runs. Works without it (plain `codex exec`).
- `codex-app-control`: a running, CDP-enabled Codex desktop App + an explicit `cdp_url`. v1 does not launch/build the app.
- `oh-my-gjc` (core) / `example-plugin`: no external prerequisites.

Content is discovered by **convention directories** above; explicit paths in
`plugin.json` are optional overrides.

## Add a plugin (procedure)

1. Create `plugins/<plugin>/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`.
2. Add content in convention dirs (`commands/`, `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`, `agents/`, `hooks/`, `.mcp.json`).
3. Register it in `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` under `plugins`:
   ```json
   { "name": "<plugin>", "source": "./plugins/<plugin>", "version": "0.1.0", "description": "…", "category": "…" }
   ```
4. Add `plugins/<plugin>/README.md` with usage, prerequisites, and safety notes.

`source` may also point off-repo: `{ "repo": "owner/repo" }`, `{ "url": "https://…" }`, or `{ "package": "npm-pkg" }`.

## Conventions agents MUST follow

- **Match the existing shape.** New manifests/commands/skills must mirror the
  existing `oh-my-gjc` / `example-plugin` structure (same `plugin.json` fields,
  YAML frontmatter on `commands/*.md` and `SKILL.md`). No parallel conventions.
- **Name parity.** `marketplace.json` entry `name` == `plugin.json` `name` == the
  `plugins/<name>/` directory. `source` must be `./plugins/<name>`.
- **Lowercase-hyphen names** for plugins and skills.
- **Register every new plugin** in `marketplace.json`, and keep the entry list
  formatting consistent with siblings.
- **Skill `description`** is the activation trigger — make it specific and include
  the phrases that should load the skill.
- **Never commit secrets.** `.env`/`.env.*` are gitignored (`!.env.example` is the
  only tracked one and MUST contain placeholders, never real keys). Runtime state
  under `.gjc/` is gitignored.
- **Document the real install paths** (verified): shell `gjc plugin install <name>@<marketplace> …` (batch-capable) and the in-chat `/plugin` slash command. Don't claim the shell CLI is unavailable.

## Per-plugin notes

### `codex-cli-control` (working)
- Skill `codex-cli-ask` + command `/codex-cli-control:ask`. gjc runs
  `codex exec --sandbox <mode> --skip-git-repo-check --ephemeral -o <file> -` and
  returns the `-o` last-message.
- **Security contract (do not weaken):** `prompt` is passed via env → **stdin only**
  (never in argv); `sandbox` validated against the exact enum (default `read-only`);
  `timeout_s` positive int ≤ 600; `model` matches `^[A-Za-z0-9._/-]+$`; `cwd` must be
  an existing dir; unknown args rejected; `--dangerously-bypass-*` / `danger-full-access`
  never auto-derived. Prompting Codex is a privileged action (it can touch files/shell/creds).
- Non-Goals: App/CDP GUI control, multi-turn sessions, MCP, codex auto-login/install.
- Read-only Q&A only; for autonomous file-writing work see `codex-deepwork`.

### `codex-deepwork` (working)
- Skill `codex-deepwork` + command `/codex-deepwork:run`. gjc delegates an autonomous
  coding task: `codex exec --sandbox workspace-write --skip-git-repo-check -C <cwd> -o <file> -`
  (task via stdin), returns the final message **plus a "review changes (git diff)" reminder**.
- **Writes files.** Default `sandbox=workspace-write`. Run in a git repo; never auto-commit/push.
- Auto-leverages the **LazyCodex** harness in `~/.codex` (deep-work skills/agents/verification) when
  installed (`npx lazycodex-ai install`); no extra flags. Works without it (plain `codex exec`).
- **Security contract (do not weaken):** same as `codex-cli-control` but task via stdin and
  `timeout_s` ≤ 3600; `cwd` must be an existing dir; `--dangerously-bypass-*` / `danger-full-access`
  never auto-derived.
- Non-Goals: read-only Q&A (→ `codex-cli-control`), App/CDP (→ `codex-app-control`), lazycodex
  auto-install, multi-session orchestration, auto-commit/push.

### `lazycodex` (working)
- Commands: `/lazycodex:setup [doctor|install|update|uninstall]` (manage the OmO Codex Light harness in `~/.codex` via `npx lazycodex-ai`) + `/lazycodex:work` (run a plan→work→verify *ultrawork* task via `codex exec`).
- **Setup mutates `~/.codex`** (skills/hooks/agents/config) + uses npm/network. Check `lazycodex doctor` first; never reinstall a healthy install or uninstall without explicit user request; no auto-login.
- `:work` writes files (default `workspace-write`); same injection-safe contract as `codex-deepwork` (task via stdin, enum sandbox, `timeout_s` ≤ 3600, cwd dir, unknown-arg reject, no bypass derivation).
- Verified here: `lazycodex doctor` = System OK (omo 4.11.0); `codex exec` auto-engages `omo:programming` + verification gates.
- Non-Goals: codex/lazycodex auto-login, App/CDP (→ `codex-app-control`), read-only Q&A (→ `codex-cli-control`), opencode (Ultimate) edition.

### `codex-app-control` (live-verified)
- Two skills: `codex-app-launch` (command `/codex-app-control:launch`) and `codex-app-cdp` (command `/codex-app-control:ask`).
- `codex-app-launch`: starts an **already-built** Linux Codex App wrapper headlessly (xvfb) with `--remote-debugging-port` (CDP) enabled, idempotently reuses a live endpoint, polls `/json/version` until ready, returns `cdp_url`; also `status`/`stop`. Does **not** build the wrapper from the DMG.
- `codex-app-cdp`: attaches gjc's `browser` tool to a running Codex App via an explicit `cdp_url`, sends one prompt, reads the latest completed response (hybrid turn-completion detection). Attach-only; pair it with `launch` (or an app you started yourself).
- **Live-verified:** wrapper built from OpenAI DMG → headless launch (CDP `:9222`, webview `:5175`, Codex `26.623.70822`) → attach → `.ProseMirror` input → Enter → completion detect → read `[data-local-conversation-final-assistant]`. Confirmed selectors/recipe live in `skills/*/SKILL.md`.
- Injection-safe arg contract (launch): `action` enum, integer port range, `screen` regex, existing-file check, reject unknown args, no auto-derived Electron flags.
- Same privileged-action safety stance as above.

### `insane-review` (CLI pack pipeline verified; CDP path deferred)
- Command `/insane-review:review` + a native-installable skill (`skills/insane-review/SKILL.md`). Faithful port of `fivetaku/insane-review`. gjc scopes the complete relevant file set → repomix packs it (full code, line numbers, secretlint, packed-file audit) → drives the **logged-in ChatGPT web session over CDP** → selects+**verifies** GPT-5.5 Pro (fail-closed) → harvests the review to the current project's `.insane-review/response_*.md`. Zero API cost (runs on the user's ChatGPT subscription). Also a web-only `agent-council` member via `--council` (see `references/council-setup.md`).
- **gjc surfaces NEITHER plugin skills NOR plugin commands as first-class** — two separate gaps, both verified on gjc 0.8.2 (`main` & `dev`): (1) the skill registry drops non-native skills (`skills.ts`: `if (provider !== "native") return false`); (2) the marketplace slash-command provider (`discovery/claude-plugins.ts`) is **never registered** because `discovery/index.ts` omits `import "./claude-plugins"` (only test files import it, and the provider self-registers only on import), so a plugin's `commands/*.md` are NOT advertised as `/<plugin>:<command>` in ANY session (proven via ACP `available_commands_update`: zero marketplace-plugin commands, only builtins + native `skill:*`). So after `gjc plugin install`, BOTH `/insane-review:review` AND its `SKILL.md` auto-activation are dead until **natively installed**. `bin/install-skill.sh` copies SKILL.md into `~/.gjc/agent/skills/insane-review/` (user) or `<cwd>/.gjc/skills/` (project); the command surface needs the same treatment for `commands/*.md` → `~/.gjc/agent/commands/<name>.md` (oh-my-gjc's `install-skill.sh` now installs both, naming commands `oh-my-gjc:<name>.md` to preserve the `/oh-my-gjc:<name>` UX — the filename IS the native command name). Applies to every marketplace plugin, not just this one.
- **Engine kept byte-for-byte** (`bin/pack_and_ask.py`, Playwright-based, cross-platform). The gjc port only rewrote the shell: skill/command adapted to gjc terms + the `ask` tool onboarding, and the Claude-Code `setup/` (GitHub-star prompt + `~/.claude/settings.json` SessionStart update hook) was **dropped**. Do not reimplement the engine flow with gjc's `browser` tool — the hardened engine is more robust.
- **Path resolution:** `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` is NOT substituted in gjc command/skill bodies, so both docs resolve the engine into `$IR` via a glob (`~/.gjc/plugins/cache/plugins/*insane-review*/bin/pack_and_ask.py`, with project-scope + repo-local fallbacks). Never invoke via `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` in a gjc plugin.
- **Security contract (do not weaken):** repomix secretlint forced on (a local repomix config disabling it aborts the run); fail-closed on unverified model / unattached pack / truncated prompt / timeout / empty response (no partial save); `--require-model` must accompany `--model`; output files `chmod 600`. Prompting Pro ships relevant code to an external web service — personal subscription use only (not OpenAI-endorsed).
- **Prerequisites (manual):** Python `playwright`+`pyperclip` (`--check-env --install`), Node/`npx` (repomix auto via `npx -y`), and a Chromium-family browser on CDP `:9222` with a **dedicated profile** logged into chatgpt.com + GPT-5.5 Pro selected. Login can't be automated.
- **Verified here (2026-07):** engine AST/`--help`/`--list-browsers`/`--check-env` on Linux; `$IR` glob resolution against a simulated install dir; `--pack-only` end-to-end via `npx repomix@1.15.0` (packed-file audit + token count). CDP→ChatGPT harvest needs a logged-in Pro session and is deferred-environment.
- Non-Goals: GPT-5.5 Pro API (doesn't exist), auto-login, engine reimplementation on gjc `browser`, read-only Q&A to a local CLI (→ `codex-cli-control`).

### `oh-my-gjc` (core — absorbed my-workflows v0.3 + multivendor-presets v0.2)
- **The install-first core plugin.** Skills: `easy-answer` (plain-language final answers, accuracy-first), `gate-briefing` (domain-blind approval-gate briefing: layman translation → approval boundary → evidence-backed checklist → verdict; "명시 없음" rows ≥2 auto-forces 보류; never executes approve/reject on the user's behalf), `multivendor-presets` (name-scoped preset merge). Commands: `/oh-my-gjc:setup` (idempotent; native-skill install via `bin/install-skill.sh all`, legacy cleanup offers, env detection → optional-plugin recommendations), `easy`/`gate` (session toggles), `easy-always`/`gate-always` (AGENTS.md marker-block semaphores), `presets`, `fable` (Fable 5 adversarial safety audit of money/data/security-critical code — read-only invariant-breaking, not architecture review; scopes 3–6 files → defender-framed audit prompt → `gjc -p --model anthropic/claude-fable-5:xhigh` in background → mandatory spot-check of top findings against real code → gate-briefing-style verdict; Opus-4-8 fallback on Fable refusal/clamp; proven to catch a CRITICAL that 8-stage 3-vendor consensus missed).
- **Native install is REQUIRED, not optional** (root cause in the insane-review note above): gjc loads neither plugin skills nor plugin `/oh-my-gjc:*` commands. `bin/install-skill.sh all` installs the 3 skills into `~/.gjc/agent/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` AND all 7 commands into `~/.gjc/agent/commands/oh-my-gjc:<name>.md` (ACP-verified: all 7 `/oh-my-gjc:*` then advertised). **First-time bootstrap must run from the shell** — `bash ~/.gjc/plugins/cache/plugins/*oh-my-gjc*/bin/install-skill.sh all` — because `/oh-my-gjc:setup` is itself one of the dead-until-installed commands (chicken-and-egg). Re-run after every plugin upgrade; open a NEW gjc session (or `/move .`) so the slash-command palette rebuilds.
- **Semaphore mechanism:** `*-always` commands own ONLY their marker block (`<!-- BEGIN/END oh-my-gjc:<name> -->`) in user-global `~/.gjc/agent/AGENTS.md`; back up to `.bak-<ts>` first; never touch content outside markers; exactly one block. This is the correct "매번 자동" mechanism: gjc does NOT auto-load plugin `SKILL.md` (native `.gjc` skills only) and plugin hooks are constrained, so a context-file block is the only every-turn surface. **Legacy migration:** old `my-workflows:easy-always`/`gate-always` marker blocks are replaced/removed by the new commands; `status` treats either marker generation as ON.
- **Presets (v0.2, 2026-07 evidence research):** `ideal` (display ideal-v2 — default `anthropic/claude-opus-4-8:xhigh`, executor `…:max`, planner+architect `openai-codex/gpt-5.5:xhigh` [cross-vendor code review: opus authors, gpt reviews], critic `xai/grok-4.3:high` [third-vendor independent gate]), `escalate-surgical` (relief pitcher — executor `anthropic/claude-fable-5:xhigh` only; return to ideal when done), `monorepo` (every role ≥1M ctx; critic `opencode-go/glm-5.2` with distillation-correlation caveat). Deprecates `ultimate`/`ultimate-f5` (v0.1) — `/oh-my-gjc:presets` detects and offers cleanup with user consent. Source of truth mirrors the user's `~/.gjc/agent/models.yml`.
- **Merge safety contract (do not weaken):** name-scoped only (replace the target profile block if present, else append under `profiles:`); never delete/modify other profiles or top-level keys (`default`, `modelBindings`, …) — legacy ultimate/ultimate-f5 removal is the sole exception and requires explicit user consent; back up to `.bak-<ts>` first; result must be valid YAML with the target present or roll back (no partial save); preserve 2/6-space indentation + `required_providers`/`model_mapping` structure + original comments. The comment-preserving merge is agent-driven (via `read`/`edit`) rather than a PyYAML round-trip, which would drop the Korean rationale comments.
- **⚠ `escalate-surgical` executor must be `:xhigh`, not `:max`** — Fable 5 silently clamps `:max` down to `xhigh`; Fable refusals arrive as HTTP 200 + stop_reason. Activation hard-blocks when any required provider lacks credentials (verified at `--mpreset` time, not at merge time). Selectors/prices are catalog- and time-sensitive (2026-07); re-verify with `gjc -p --no-session --no-tools --model <selector> "Reply OK"`.
- Non-Goals: reimplementing gjc-native workflows (team/ultragoal/ralplan/deep-interview), vendor auto-login, profile auto-injection (manifest unsupported — merge is explicit-command only), selector/price freshness guarantees.

### `gjc-bugwatch` (collector verified on real logs; triage/PR is agent-driven)
- Dogfooding bug collector. `bin/collect.ts` (batch scanner) reads `~/.gjc/logs/*.log` **and rotated `*.log.gz`** (structured JSONL: `{level,message,stack,...}`) and optionally session transcripts (`~/.gjc/agent/sessions/--<cwd>--/*.jsonl`), classifies signals (`gjc-internal`/`error`/`warn`), filters env/credential noise, dedupes by normalized fingerprint, redacts email/UUID/token/creds-in-URL, and **marks candidates not seen within `--fresh-days` (default 2) as `⏳stale` (likely already fixed upstream) — sinking them below fresh ones (`--fresh-only` drops them)**. `/gjc-bugwatch:scan` + skill drive triage → reproduce against a `/tmp` gajae-code clone → collect issue/PR **drafts** under `.gjc/bugwatch/drafts/`.
- **Precision split (important):** the **log** source is high-precision (real runtime stacks; ~0 false positives — verified: it surfaced `Cleanup invoked recursively` ×7 with a `/$bunfs/root/gjc-*` stack, `Subagent prompt failed`, `Claude usage fetch failed`, etc. from the author's real logs). **Session** scanning is opt-in (`--include-sessions`) and heuristic: session JSONL echoes source code the agent read, pasted logs, and analysis prose, so it self-contaminates — it trusts ONLY `[Uncaught Exception]` and always skips the current session (`GJC_SESSION_ID`). Default = logs only.
- **The mechanical part is a tool, the judgement part is the agent.** `collect.ts` (deterministic parse/dedupe/redact, unit-tested at `test/collect.test.ts`) vs the command/skill (LLM triage, clone-repro, draft authoring). Mirrors insane-review's split.
- **Resolved ledger (dead-bug suppression).** `.gjc/bugwatch/resolved.jsonl` records bugs **confirmed fixed upstream** keyed by the exact collector `fingerprint`; `collect.ts` loads it (`loadResolved`/`applyResolved`, unit-tested) and tags matching candidates `✅resolved`, sinking them below `⏳stale` (hide with `--hide-resolved`, also dropped by `--fresh-only`; override path with `--resolved FILE`). Purpose: a fresh-looking-but-already-fixed candidate (e.g. `Cleanup invoked recursively` ×73, fixed by #1462/PR #1465 but still logged by a pre-fix installed binary) stops re-surfacing as a live lead. Triage skips `✅resolved`; when Step-3 source verification finds a merged/closed fix, the agent records it in `resolved.jsonl` (+ human `RESOLVED.md`) via subprocess instead of drafting.
- **Contract (do not weaken):** drafts only — `gh issue/pr create`, `git push`, commit, and any external submission are forbidden (a human submits). Read-only over gjc logs/sessions/source (never mutate `~/.gjc`). Redaction stays on (candidates are meant to be pasteable into a public upstream issue). Dedupe by fingerprint (no duplicate drafts). Estimated cause/fix must be labeled "추정" unless confirmed in the clone — no fabrication. All output lives under `.gjc/` (gitignored) — and since `.gjc/**` is runtime-owned (agent `write`/`edit`/`ast_edit` are blocked there), drafts are written via a subprocess (`bun`/`fs`/`cp` from `/tmp`), exactly like the collector spools `candidates.jsonl`.
- **⛔ UPSTREAM PR TARGET = `dev`, NEVER `main` (HARD RULE).** When a human explicitly directs submission (which overrides the drafts-only default), every upstream `gajae-code` **PR MUST target the `dev` branch** (`gh pr create --base dev …`). `main` is the repo's *default* branch but upstream integrates through `dev` — a PR against `main` is wrong. There is **no direct push access** to `Yeachan-Heo/gajae-code`, so: push the fix branch to the fork `devswha/gajae-code`, then `gh pr create --repo Yeachan-Heo/gajae-code --base dev --head devswha:<branch>`. Base the branch on `origin/dev` (fetch it) — not on `main` — so the diff is clean. (Issues have no base branch; file normally.)
- Non-Goals: auto issue/PR creation or push (drafts only), a managed always-on monitoring daemon (roadmap — today `bin/follow.ts` gives session-scoped live via `tail -n0 -F ~/.gjc/logs/gjc.$(date +%F).log | bun run follow.ts`, reusing `classifyLogEntry`), changing gjc log/session formats (read-only).


### `example-plugin`
- Reference template: one command + one skill. Copy to bootstrap a new plugin.

## Verification expectations

Before considering a plugin change done:
- **Static (always):** `marketplace.json` and `plugin.json` parse as JSON; convention
  files exist at expected paths; `marketplace` entry name/source match the manifest.
- **Behavioral (when the surface is reachable):** exercise the actual surface. The
  CLI path (`codex exec`) is testable wherever the Codex CLI is installed/logged in;
  the App/CDP path needs a running CDP-enabled Codex App and is otherwise deferred.
- Never fake live evidence. If a surface cannot be exercised in the current
  environment, mark it pending-environment and say so explicitly.

## Tools

`tools/discord-notify-bridge.ts` — forwards a live gjc session's notifications
(action-needed / idle / resolved) to a Discord channel via an incoming webhook.
Client of gjc's Notifications SDK (loopback WS at
`.gjc/state/notifications/<sessionId>.json`). Notify-only (a webhook can't reply).
Secrets read from `$DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` or `.gjc/secrets/discord-webhook`, never
logged. Tests: `bun test tools/test/e2e-bridge.test.ts`.
